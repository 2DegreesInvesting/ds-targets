# ds-targets

A series of meetups about data pipelines with the package
“[targets](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/)”.

## Syllabus

### Motivation

[Meet Will
Landau](https://github.com/2DegreesInvesting/ds-incubator/issues/70).

### Walkthrough

Setup a minimal targets project from scratch.

Objectives:

-   Setup from scratch.
-   Understand the benefit.
-   Learn the most useful functions:
    -   `tar_script()`.
    -   `tar_edit()`.
    -   `tar_make()`.
    -   `tar_visnetwork()`.
    -   `tar_objects()`.
    -   `tar_read()`.
-   Create a report that uses targets.

### Next

The rest of the series will likely cover debugging, functions, external
files and literate programming, and branching – following [targets’
manual](https://books.ropensci.org/targets/) but loosely.
