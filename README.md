# ds-targets

A series of meetups about data pipelines with the package
“[targets](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/)”.

## Syllabus

### Motivation

[Meet Will
Landau](https://github.com/2DegreesInvesting/ds-incubator/issues/70).

### Walkthrough

Setup a minimal targets project from scratch.

Objectives:

-   Setup a file "\_targets.R" and explore its
    [structure](https://books.ropensci.org/targets/walkthrough.html#file-structure).
-   Try common functions:
    -   `tar_script()`.
    -   `tar_edit()`.
    -   `tar_glimpse()`.
    -   `tar_make()`.
    -   `tar_visnetwork()`.
    -   `tar_objects()`.
    -   `tar_read()`.
-   Create a report using targets.
-   Understand the benefit.

### Next

The rest of the series will likely cover these topics:

-   Functions: Moving from a sequence of scripts to a pipeline of
    functions.
-   Target factories
-   Best practices.
-   Debugging.

We’ll follow [targets’ manual](https://books.ropensci.org/targets/) but
loosely.
