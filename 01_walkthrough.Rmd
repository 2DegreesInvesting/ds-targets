# Walkthrough

Use targets.

```{r}
library(targets)
```

Write a _targets.R script to the current working directory.

```r
tar_script()
```

Helper.

```{r}
show <- function(path) {
  lines <- readLines(here::here(path))
  header <- paste("\n#", path)
  out <- writeLines(c(header, lines))
  out
}
```

Show contents.

```{r comment=""}
show("_targets.R")
```


Open _targets.R for editing.

```r
tar_edit()
```

Run a pipeline of targets.

```r
tar_make()
```

Visualize an abridged fast dependency graph.

```{r}
tar_visnetwork()
```

Use the targets we have just made, e.g. to report your analysis results.

```{r}
tar_objects()

data <- tar_read(data)
head(data)

tar_read(summary)

plot(data)
```
