A series of meetups about data pipelines with the package
"[targets](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/)".

## Syllabus

Except for the first one, each item in this syllabus corresponds to a meetup and
a GitHub release that preserves a snapshot of this repository exactly as it was
shown during thee meetup.

Go to [releases](https://github.com/2DegreesInvesting/ds-targets/releases).

### Motivation

[Meet Will Landau](https://github.com/2DegreesInvesting/ds-incubator/issues/70).

### Walkthrough

Setup a minimal targets project from scratch.

Objectives:

- Setup a file "\_targets.R" and explore its [structure](https://books.ropensci.org/targets/walkthrough.html#file-structure).

- Try common functions:

    - `tar_script()`.
    - `tar_edit()`.
    - `tar_glimpse()`.
    - `tar_make()`.
    - `tar_visnetwork()`.
    - `tar_objects()`.
    - `tar_read()`.

- Create a report using targets.

- Understand the benefit.

### Functions

This meetup adapts the examples shown in the "Functions" chapter of targets
[manual](https://books.ropensci.org/targets/). It covers how to refactor a data
science project, moving from a workflow based on a sequence of scripts to a
workflow based on a pipeline of functions.

Objectives:

- Explore an analysis structured as a sequence of scripts.

- Make and use our own targets.

- Report multiple analyses with the same superset of targets.

- Transform code chunks into functions.

- Report the analysis as using targets.

- Make and use targets from the package targets.

### Target cues

This meetup covers the rules that mark a target as outdated. It explores the
helpfile of
[`tar_cue()`](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/reference/tar_cue.html). After
this session you will be more able to predict when `tar_make()` will either skip
or run a target, and to set the options that trigger the behavior you want.

Objective:

* Understand the
[details](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/reference/tar_cue.html#details) of
[`tar_cue()`](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/reference/tar_cue.html).

###  Best practices

This meetup covers selected topics from the chapter [Best
Practices](https://books.ropensci.org/targets/practices) of target's manual.

Objectives:

* Understand how to define good targets.

* Understand how to ignore or depend on changes in R packages.


### External files and literate programming

This meetup covers selected topics from the chapter [External files and
literate programming](https://books.ropensci.org/targets/files.html) of
targets's manual.

Objectives:

* Understand what it means for a file to be external.

* Understand how to use external files as inputs and outputs.

* Use a superset of targets in a subset of workflows (rmarkdown files).

* Use a targets factory to render rmarkdown reports inside the targets pipeline.

### Debugging

This meetup covers the chapter [Debugging](https://books.ropensci.org/targets/debugging.html) of
targets's manual.

Objectives:

* Understand three approaches to debugging, which the manual refers to as: 
    * environment browser,
    * the debug option,
    * workspaces.

### Next

The rest of the series will likely cover these topics:

- [Target
factories](https://wlandau.github.io/targetopia/contributing.html#target-factories).

We'll follow [targets' manual](https://books.ropensci.org/targets/) but loosely.
