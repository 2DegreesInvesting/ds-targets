# ds-targets

A series of meetups about data pipelines with the package
"[targets](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/)".

## Syllabus

### Motivation

By Will Landau.

### Walkthrough

Setup a minimal targets project from scratch.

Objectives:

* Setup from scratch.
* Understand the benefit.
* Learn the most useful functions:
  * `tar_script()`.
  * `tar_edit()`.
  * `tar_make()`.
  * `tar_visnetwork()`.
  * `tar_objects()`.
  * `tar_read()`.
* Create a report that uses targets.

### Next

The rest of the series will likely cover debugging, functions, external files
and literate programming, and branching -- following [targets'
manual](https://books.ropensci.org/targets/) but loosely.
